+ You gain bonuses based on the Spore you have active when standing on mycelium. Red Cap increases attack speed, Green Cap grants knockback immunity, and Blue Cap amplifies jump height while sprinting..
+- Food is decomposed before it's consumed, nullifying any status effects you would otherwise gain.
